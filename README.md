# Gun Violence in the US

This paper was written with the intention to unearth the impacts of state-by-state gun legislation on gun violence in the US.

## Introduction 

In 2017, more people, approximately 39,000 individuals, in the United States died from gun-related incidents than car crashes. The high rates of gun violence in the United States are truly unprecedented among wealthy countries.

Data containing details on gun violence incidents (GVIs), state-by-state gun laws, and state population estimates (which can be found in Data) are used to examine the following questions:

  1. Is there a relationship between mean number of laws and mean per capita casualty rate by state?

  2. Is there a relationship between gun law categories and number of gun violence incidents? And can these relationships be used to        predict future gun violence incidents?
  
  3. Is there a relationship between political parties with partisan control of the state Senate and incidents of gun violence?

## Code 

The code for reasearch Questions 2 and 3 and can be found in the GunLawCategories.Rmd and GunLawsPolParty.Rmd files respectively. 

## Findings and Results 

Gun Violence in the US.pdf contains the final report containing all discoveries, findings, statistical methods and more.
